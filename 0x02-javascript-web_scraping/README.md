This project involves working with JavaScript to perform web scraping tasks. The objectives of this project include manipulating JSON data, using request and fetch APIs, and reading/writing files using the fs module. The project includes six tasks, each with specific requirements, such as reading and printing the content of a file, writing a string to a file, displaying the status code of a GET request, and computing the number of completed tasks by user ID. The project must be completed using Node 10, and the code must be semistandard compliant. Each task has a corresponding file to be submitted in the GitHub repository holbertonschool-higher_level_programming, under the directory 0x02-javascript-web_scraping.
