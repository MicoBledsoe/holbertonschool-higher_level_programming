JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used for exchanging data between a client and a server. Serialization is the process of converting a Python object into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or processed. Deserialization is the process of converting a serialized object back into a Python object. In Python, the json module provides functions for serializing and deserializing Python objects to and from JSON strings. Unit testing is a software testing technique that involves writing test cases for individual units of code. It helps ensure that the code works as intended and helps catch bugs early in the development process. To serialize and deserialize a class, the class must be written to support the serialization process.
