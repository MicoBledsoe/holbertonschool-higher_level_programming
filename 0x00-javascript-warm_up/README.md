# 0x00-javascript-warm_up

This directory contains introductory tasks for JavaScript, focusing on fundamental concepts like variables, loops, and functions. Each file demonstrates a basic aspect of JavaScript, helping new developers become familiar with the syntax and basic operations of the language.

## Files

- `0-javascript_is_amazing.js`: A script that prints "JavaScript is amazing" using a variable.
- `1-multi_languages.js`: A script that prints three lines with different strings.
- `10-factorial.js`: A function that computes the factorial of a number.
- `11-second_biggest.js`: A script that finds the second biggest number in a list of arguments.
- `12-object.js`: Modifies an existing object to demonstrate object manipulation.
- `13-add.js`: A function that returns the addition of two numbers.
- `2-arguments.js`: A script that prints a message based on the number of arguments passed.
- `3-value_argument.js`: A script that prints the first argument passed to it.
- `4-concat.js`: A script that prints two arguments passed to it, concatenated.
- `5-to_integer.js`: A script that converts an argument to an integer.
- `6-multi_languages_loop.js`: A script that prints 3 lines using an array of strings and a loop.
- `7-multi_c.js`: A script that prints "C is fun" x times where x is the first argument of the script.
- `8-square.js`: A script that prints a square using the character `X`.
- `9-add.js`: A script that prints the addition of two integers.

Each script is designed to be run with Node.js and adheres to the semistandard style.
